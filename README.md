# hello-world
This is my first repo, of many to come

My name is Douglas. I am a young almost-engineer. I have studied at the Federal University of Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys, at The University of Sydney and now I am at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
Next I plan to revolutionise the world with a high impact solution to many of human problems I am still to find out.
